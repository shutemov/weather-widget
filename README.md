Meet the weather-widget as a web component for your application based on Vue 3.   

You can see how the widget works here: [https://shutemov.github.io/weather-widget/](https://shutemov.github.io/weather-widget/)  

Just add <weather-widget /> as an html tag and upload the script:

### ‚ú® Features:
+ Saves the state between site visits
+ Interact with the geolocation (waiting for switching permissions, shows the empty state of the application)
+ Uses data from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)
+ Uses vue-router to control the application

### üöß Current restrictions:
+ 1 widget per site
+ There is no support for props

### üêû Bug

There is a bug with the geo-location that I can't track in the allotted time.  
When trying to use a component in an html _file_, navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition calls prompt every time it is called, while on github pages and with local serve everything works as expected.
