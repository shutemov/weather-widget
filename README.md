Meet the weather-widget as a web component for your application based on Vue 3.   

You can see how the widget works here: [https://shutemov.github.io/weather-widget/](https://shutemov.github.io/weather-widget/)  

Just add <weather-widget /> as an html tag and upload the script:

```

```

### âœ¨ Features:
+ Saves the state between site visits
+ Interact with the geolocation (waiting for switching permissions, shows the empty state of the application)
+ Uses data from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)
+ Uses vue-router to control the application

### ðŸš§ Current restrictions:
+ 1 widget per site
+ There is no support for props

+ It is necessary to serve html using a web server for the correct operation of the geo location api. It seems to be due to browser restrictions when working with files from the file system (_file:_//).

### ðŸ”¨What need to add:  
+ Props support in the web component (currently it is impossible to build a web component using the vue 3 cli).
